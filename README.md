## Lost And Found
Lost and Found is an application developed in Flutter for iOS and Android devices.

Lost And Found is designed to collect all reports of lost or found items on a single platform. Each user can report a lost item, and thanks to the features available in Lost and Found, he will be notified if his lost item has been possibly found by another user. Then the user who lost the item and the user who found it will be able to chat and arrange the return of the item. Lost and Found enables users to report items of two categories:
- Lost: indicating items that users have lost;
- Found: indicating items that users have found, presumably lost by someone else.

A user can:
- Report the loss of an item:
  1. The user submits a report of a lost item through the app;
  2. The user can search to see if the lost item has been found by another user using the search functionality;
  3. The user will receive a notification when another user submits a report for a found item that might match his lost item;
  4. When the user finds an item that matches one of his lost items, he can make a ”claim”. The claim process involves answering a question to prove the item’s ownership. The user who reported the found item creates an appropriate question and evaluates the correctness of the claims’ response.

- Report the finding of an item:
  1. The user enters a report for the found item in the application and creates a question to verify the legitimacy of possible future claims;
  2. The user can check if there is a missing report, for the found item he inserted, using the search functionality;
  3. The user will receive a notification when another user submits a report for a lost item that might match his found item;
  4. When the found item receives a claim from a user, the user who found the item will assess the accuracy of the response to the proposed question. If the response is accurate, the user will be contacted to arrange the return of the lost item. Once a claim has been approved by the user who found the item, then that item won’t be visible anymore through the app.
